## What You Should Know About Our Argon Welding Service
Argon welding is a welding method that has been used in the collision repair industry for years, and often it’s used as a shielding agent. A shielding agent is required because, during the welding process, a piece of metal’s temperature can exceed 5000°. Argon is a colorless gas, and it doesn&#39;t have an odor either. It isn’t a flammable gas, nor is it toxic. Most vehicle welding is done using the argon welding method, and this is what our
technicians specialize in.
If your vehicle requires argon welding, then it&#39;s best to get in touch with our team. Our licensed and certified argon welding experts are preferred by those who need argon welding in NJ, and they will deliver expert-quality work, in a short amount of time and for a fair price. If you want your car&#39;s body to look like it just came out of the shop, we are the welding experts to get in touch with.
## Why Argon Welding Is Important
When a metal reaches thousands of degrees in temperature, it will turn into a liquid, and it's here when a metal is weldable. Argon is specifically used to protect this molten pool of metal from the elements in the atmosphere, as often oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen can inhibit the welding process from taking place properly.
These elements may also cause a reaction with the metal pool, and porosity as well as increased weld splatter are two of the common results. Argon is also a significant factor in maintaining arc stability, and this means with argon comes more weld penetration, better filler wire transfer, and better weld appearance.

Because welding is highly technical work, it should only be executed by true specialists.
If, for example, you have a luxury car that has an expensive body, our welding experts are the ones to get in touch with. They'll take care when handling your vehicle, and they'll ensure it looks flawless when you get it back from us.
