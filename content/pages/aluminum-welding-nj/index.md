## Everything You Need To Know About Our Aluminum Welding Service
Cars, trucks, and other vehicles have been including aluminum for a long time, which
means that those in the collision repair industry work with aluminum often. If a vehicle
has a low production number, there’s a good chance it includes a lot of aluminum
components, and this is because aluminum can be easily created by hand and is less
expensive when compared to steel components.

If you've been looking for a reliable body shop that delivers aluminum welding in NJ, we
are the experts to get in touch with. We can deliver frame repair, frame straightening,
dent removal, collision repair, and many other useful services. All of our technicians are
licensed and certified, and this is why we are a top choice for those who need aluminum
welding work in Linden, as well as the surrounding area.

When your car or truck exits our shop, you'll forget that its aluminum components were
ever damaged or badly worn.

## The Importance of Aluminum Welding
Aluminum welding will likely be needed after a collision, and this is where our
technicians can be of service. We have the tools, experience, and know-how necessary
to work with all kinds of aluminum, and we will use the welding method that is most
appropriate for the aluminum your vehicle includes. You don't want to be driving around
with damaged aluminum components after a minor collision, so in this instance you
should see our technicians right away.
### Why Vehicles Are Including More Aluminum
These days, more and more vehicles are including aluminum components, as
manufacturers are trying to make their vehicles more fuel-efficient without sacrificing
integrity or performance. This move towards lighter-weight vehicles is also being
pushed by Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations.

While aluminum is a thin metal, it still can provide a lot of strength. It is often used to
construct frames and body panels, and this is especially true for larger vehicles. There
are also now entire bodies being made out of aluminum, as is the case with some Ford
F-150s.
Since aluminum components are becoming more common, the need for technicians
who know how to work with aluminum is growing too. We can be there when you need
aluminum welding after a collision, and our welding services won’t break your bank.
This is another reason why we’re sought after by those who need aluminum welding in
NJ.
## Guiding Clients Through Our Process
If you have questions about our aluminum welding process, feel free to ask our
technicians. They will explain how welding works, and they’ll do so in terms you'll
understand. We can even come pick up your car and bring it to our repair shop in
Linden. When you get it back from us, the damage that was once there will be a thing of

good chance we can provide same-day service.
