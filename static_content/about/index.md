## Our company was established in 2007. Since we have satisfied our customer with our outstanding deals and quality of work.


We specializes in repairing late model vehicles. Our collision shop will put your vehicle back to pre-accident condition, structurally and cosmetically. Using factory specification we straighten the frame or uni-body to itâ€™s pre-accident condition, parts are replaced with OEM, (Original Equipment Manufacture), reconditioned, or with Aftermarket Parts, (Lifetime Guarantee), depending on the customers request and budget. We then refinish the repaired or replaced parts with a factory package paint. This is the same paint that is used at the factory when the vehicle was originally built. This way we can assure the same color quality and texture as the factory finish.
