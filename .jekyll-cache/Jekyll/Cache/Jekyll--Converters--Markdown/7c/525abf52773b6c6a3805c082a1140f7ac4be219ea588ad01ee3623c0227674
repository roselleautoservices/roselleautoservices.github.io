<p>Cars, trucks, and other vehicles have been including aluminum for a long time, which
means that those in the collision repair industry work with aluminum often. If a vehicle
has a low production number, thereâ€™s a good chance it includes a lot of aluminum
components, and this is because aluminum can be easily created by hand and is less
expensive when compared to steel components.</p>

are the experts to get in touch with. We can deliver frame repair, frame straightening,
dent removal, collision repair, and many other useful services. All of our technicians are

<h3 id="why-vehicles-are-including-more-aluminum">Why Vehicles Are Including More Aluminum</h3>
<p>These days, more and more vehicles are including aluminum components, as
manufacturers are trying to make their vehicles more fuel-efficient without sacrificing
integrity or performance. This move towards lighter-weight vehicles is also being
pushed by Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations.</p>

<p>While aluminum is a thin metal, it still can provide a lot of strength. It is often used to
construct frames and body panels, and this is especially true for larger vehicles. There
are also now entire bodies being made out of aluminum, as is the case with some Ford
F-150s.
Since aluminum components are becoming more common, the need for technicians
who know how to work with aluminum is growing too. We can be there when you need
aluminum welding after a collision, and our welding services wonâ€™t break your bank.
This is another reason why weâ€™re sought after by those who need aluminum welding in
